I am currently a research assistant student in Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Faculty of Engineering from Monash University. My workplace is located in MSRI (Monash Suzhou Research Institute), Suzhou, China. Now, my research topic is simulation of hydrogen catalytical flameless combustion in a microchannel reactor, and my main supervisor is Prof. [Jianglong Yu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianglong-yu). Meanwhile, my associated supervisor is Prof. [Sankar Bhattacharya](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sankar-bhattacharya) and A/Prof. [Baiqian Dai](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bai-qian-dai).

Before July 2023, I was a Bachelor in electronic information engineering from Fuzhou University, Fujian, China. When I was an undergraduate, my research work focused on deep learning, signal processing and AI edge system. [You can click here to view my resume.](https://shannongsr.github.io/cv/)

During my undergraduate period, I received the guidance of Prof. [Zhijian Lin](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1013/1916.htm) and Prof. [Pingping Chen](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1012/1070.htm) and did some research on machine learning, communication signal processing and AI edge computing.

At the same time, I also got a lot of help from my class adviser, Dr. [Gang Mou](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1018/1061.htm). We have cooperated in the research of image processing.

I was an intern in Quanzhou Institute of Equipment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. There, I accept the guidance of Dr. [Jun Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~121) and Mr. [Yin Gao](http://www.casqiem.ac.cn/doclist.action?chnlid=3167) to learn about image processing and robot control.


Want to design something interesting with me? 
======
I like to build embedded systems and customize some interesting things. I can use Python, C, C++, MATLAB, Verilog to program. I am good at using MDK v5, Arduino, STM32CubeMX, Altium Designer, etc. to design embedded systems.

Since junior high school, I have been very interested in custom design, and I hope I can customize a game console. In university, I was lucky to have the opportunity to learn electronic information engineering, which enabled me to learn a lot about embedded systems and enable me to "customize" many interesting things. If you are interested in my design, you can take a look at some relevant videos I published in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/25541376?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0/).

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
