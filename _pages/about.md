I am currently a PhD student at the School of Energy and Environment, Southeast University, and I am jointly supervised by the Chemical Engineering Department at Monash University. My main supervisor is Prof. [Jianglong Yu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianglong-yu). Meanwhile, my associated supervisor is Prof. [Zhuguang Can](https://https://power.seu.edu.cn/zgc/list.htm) and Prof. [Sankar Bhattacharya](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sankar-bhattacharya).

In July 2024, I completed my Master's degree in Material and Chemical Engineering from North China University of Science and Technology. During my Master's, I conducted research on the construction of coal molecular structures under the supervision of Prof. [Guangyue Li](https://hg.ncst.edu.cn/col/1684291858330/2022/10/03/1664764516444.html) and Dr. Hang Zhang. I developed the [GenCoal tool](https://gencoal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python software package designed to generate feasible lignin structures. The code belongs to the [Guangyue Li Group](https://github.com/GYLiGroup).

My current research interests focus on the molecular structure evolution of coal pyrolysis and coking, with applications involving digital twins, Three.js, deep learning, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

I am collaborating with Yuhang Qiu on designing the [smart-coking system software](http:///) for Prof. Jianglong Yu's group, which is under development for commercialization, with an expected release in June 2025.

Additionally, I am passionate about developing practical algorithms to support scientific plotting and work. Some of my previous projects include drawing [chessboard plot](colab) and [rebursement App](colab).

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
