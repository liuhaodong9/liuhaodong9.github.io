I am currently a PhD student in Southeast University School of Engergy and Environment. And I和联合培养Chemical Engineering from Monash University. My main supervisor is Prof. [Jianglong Yu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianglong-yu). Meanwhile, my associated supervisor is Prof. [Zhuguang Can](https://https://power.seu.edu.cn/zgc/list.htm) and Prof. [Sankar Bhattacharya](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sankar-bhattacharya).

At July 2024, I got a Master degree in material and chemical engineering from North China University of Science and Technology. When I was an undergraduate, my research work focused on Java的web开发. [You can click here to view my resume.](https://liuhaodong9.github.io//cv/)  My research field include 煤的热解和焦化的分子结构演化、研究用到了数字孪生、web全栈开发、深度学习、动力学模拟、量子化学计算, and

During my undergraduate period, I received the guidance of Prof. [Zhijian Lin](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1013/1916.htm) and Prof. [Pingping Chen](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1012/1070.htm) and did some research on machine learning, communication signal processing and AI edge computing.

At the same time, I also got a lot of help from my class adviser, Dr. [Gang Mou](https://xjzz.fzu.edu.cn/info/1018/1061.htm). We have cooperated in the research of image processing.

I was an intern in Quanzhou Institute of Equipment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. There, I accept the guidance of Dr. [Jun Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~121) and Mr. [Yin Gao](http://www.casqiem.ac.cn/doclist.action?chnlid=3167) to learn about image processing and robot control.


Want to design something interesting with me? 
======
I like to build embedded systems and customize some interesting things. I can use Python, C, C++, MATLAB, Verilog to program. I am good at using MDK v5, Arduino, STM32CubeMX, Altium Designer, etc. to design embedded systems.

Since junior high school, I have been very interested in custom design, and I hope I can customize a game console. In university, I was lucky to have the opportunity to learn electronic information engineering, which enabled me to learn a lot about embedded systems and enable me to "customize" many interesting things. If you are interested in my design, you can take a look at some relevant videos I published in [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/25541376?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0/).

I look forward to any interesting cooperation!
