I am currently a PhD student at the School of Energy and Environment, Southeast University, and I am jointly supervised by the Chemical Engineering Department at Monash University. My major is environmental science and engnieering. My main supervisor is Prof. [Jianglong Yu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jianglong-yu). Meanwhile, my associated supervisor is Prof. [Zhuguang Can](https://power.seu.edu.cn/zgc/list.htm) and Prof. [Sankar Bhattacharya](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/sankar-bhattacharya).

In July 2024, I completed my Master's degree in Material and Chemical Engineering from North China University of Science and Technology. During my Master's, I conducted an AI-drived research project on the construction of coal molecular structures under the supervision of Prof. [Guangyue Li](https://hg.ncst.edu.cn/col/1684291858330/2022/10/03/1664764516444.html) and Dr. Hang Zhang. I developed the [GenCoal tool](https://gencoal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python software package designed to generate molecular structures of all coal ranks. The code and patent for this invention belongs to the [Guangyue Li Group](https://github.com/GYLiGroup).

My current research interests focus on the molecular structure evolution of coal pyrolysis and coking process. This involves applications in digital twins, web development, deep learning, molecular dynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations.

I have contributed to the design of fully automated coke ovens and the development of smart-coking software for commercialization. This fully automated coke oven system integrates coal blending, stamping, heating chambers, cooling chambers, and a control center. The system is structured into three main layers: the software layer, the physical equipment layer, and the control layer, ensuring efficient and intelligent coke production.

Additionally, I have developed a coal molecular model construction software for faculty and students, which is available on the intranet of the School of Chemical Engineering at North China University of Science and Technology.

I am always open to exciting research collaborations and innovative projects. Please feel free to reach out for potential cooperation opportunities!
